#+TITLE: Notes on repurposing the Fleming et al disambig library for PATSTAT

* Load
- Appears easiest for data to go in as a single table, where you can
  index it in the berkeleydb first. Could write more sophisticated
  queries, but might have to index on the backend. Doesn't appear necessary.
- =data.desc= file specifies the format of each row and the type
  declarations
- Implies some denormalization of the db, which would require choosing
  the priority fields for disambiguation
- 

* Block
- See Fleming et al's USPTO table on blocking suggestions. They use
  rare names. Could clean the names, count the freqs, and take the
  rare names
- The default =blocking_callback= only operates on the =Block1= field,
  so far as I can tell, as defined in =data.desc=
- 

* Index
- If we do the join, then need to reindex? Might be easier to export
  from the MySQL db the combined table we want, then just load it into
  SQLlite as a single widget.

* Compare
- Note the compare functions for the class and author data assume
  strings separated by =/= values. 
- Have to update the 
- Possible comparison fields for PATSTAT:
  - Name
  - IPC codes (top N?) -- already knows how to handle this
  - Coauthor -- does with jw stringcmp
  - Person country code (note that 13m of 39m records here are blank)
  - Person address (note that 26m of 39m records here are blank)
  
  Don't have lat/lon, separate first/middle/last names to block on here.

* Tag
- in =apply_tag= need to specify how the tag should be constructed,
  otherwise appears to just assign the inventor number again.
